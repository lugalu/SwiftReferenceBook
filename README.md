# SwiftReferenceBook

## What is this?
A simple book about swift, you can use this to remember quickly and locally about some topics, these are based on what I want to write, feel free to use this for study or to help your work.

## It's all comments?
When opening XCode open the right tab and click render documentation, this way all the markdown will be loaded!

## Can I help?
Unfortunately no, I don't want help since I made this for myself, this way I create a quick reference and fixate the content in my head!

## When more content will be added?
Well it depends on my mood to write, it can be today, tomorrow, in the near future or never, who knows? life is a box of surprises!
